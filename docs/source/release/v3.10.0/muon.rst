Interfaces
----------
Muon Analysis
-  The new algorithms :ref:`EstimateMuonAsymmetryFromCounts <algm-EstimateMuonAsymmetryFromCounts-v1>`: and :ref:`CalculateMuonAsymmetry <algm-CalculateMuonAsymmetry-v1>` are now used in the muon analysis GUI.
-  The main part of the multiple fitting GUI has been upgraded to be more user friendly.


- Fixed a bug that meant transverse field asymmetry data was normalized to bin width. 

Algorithms
----------
-  :ref:`EstimateMuonAsymmetryFromCounts <algm-EstimateMuonAsymmetryFromCounts-v1>`: new algorithm to estimate the asymmetry.
-  :ref:`CalculateMuonAsymmetry <algm-CalculateMuonAsymmetry-v1>`: new algorithm to calculate the asymmetry by using a fitting function.
